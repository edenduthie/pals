_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Enter the information for a set intersection display.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      getIntersectList(nelem,xnames=NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   nelem: The number of sets for which the intersections will be
          displayed.

  xnames: The labels for the set intersections. The function creates
          names from combinations of the first 'nelem' capital letters
          if none are  given.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'getIntersectList' allows the user to manually enter the counts of
     set intersections rather than build this information from a matrix
     of data. It is probably most useful for producing an intersection
     diagram when the counts of the intersections are already known.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list of the counts of elements in the set intersections.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:
