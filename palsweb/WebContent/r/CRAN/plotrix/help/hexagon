_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Draws a hexagon on the current graphic device.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      hexagon(x,y,unitcell=1,col=NA,border="black")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     x,y: x and y position of the bottom left corner of the square that
          would pack into the same space as the hexagon.

unitcell: The dimension of the side of the abovementioned square.

     col: The color to fill the hexagon - default is no fill.

  border: The color of the perimeter of the hexagon.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     nil

_N_o_t_e:

     Draws a hexagon with the same center as a square that would pack
     into the same dimensions as the hexagon. That is, given a grid of
     squares with alternate rows shifted one half the length of the
     sides, the hexagons drawn would be close packed. Its use in the
     plotrix package is to provide an alternative unit cell for the
     'color2D.matplot' function.
