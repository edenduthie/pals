<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

<h3>Fair use policy</h3>
<p>
Inclusion of any type of data set in PALS in no way implies consent for its use beyond application in experiments for the PALS site itself - consent for any other use must be negotiated with data set owners. All observed and modelled datasets in PALS have an associated owner or chief investigator field displayed in their meta data. Consent or collaboration outside the PALS site is entirely at the discretion of the data owner. 
</p>
<p>
For information regarding the use of PALS scripts or graphs for publications, please email palshelp at gmail dot com. 
</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
While the administrators of PALS aim to make PALS as reliable and secure as possible, we take no responsibility whatsoever for any loss incurred as a result of the use of PALS, availability of the PALS site, faults in the structure or operation of PALS or inappropriate use of the PALS site by its users.
</p>
<p>
It is the responsibility of individual users to ensure they adhere to any institutional guidelines by which they are bound regarding the dissemination of data, model code or experimental results.
