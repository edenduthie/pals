_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Display rectangles shaded to appear like cylinders.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      cylindrect(xleft,ybottom,xright,ytop,col,border=NA,gradient="x",nslices=50)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   xleft: The position of the left side of the rectangle(s).

 ybottom: The position of the bottom of the rectangle(s).

  xright: The position of the right side of the rectangle(s).

    ytop: The position of the top side of the rectangle(s).

     col: The base color(s) of the rectangles.

  border: Whether to draw a border and what color.

gradient: Whether to vary the shading horizontally ("x" - the default)
          or vertically (anything but "x").

 nslices: The number of "slices" of color for shading.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'cylindrect' displays a rectangle filled with "slices" of color
     that simulate the appearance of a cylinder. The slices are
     calculated so that the  base color appears at the right or bottom
     edge of the rectangle, become progressively lighter to a
     "highlight" at two thirds of the width or height and then darken
     toward the base color again.

     The appearance is of a cylinder lit from above and to the left of
     the viewer. The position of the apparent light source is hard
     coded into the function.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The base color(s) of the rectangle(s).
