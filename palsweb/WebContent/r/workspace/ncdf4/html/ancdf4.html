<h2>Read, write, and create netCDF files (including version 4 format)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>Read from or write to existing netCDF format files, or create new ones.
This is the R-ncdf4 package, version 1.6.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<p>More information on this package, including detailed installation instructions,
can be found at http://dwpierce.com/software.
</p>
<p>The netCDF data file format from Unidata is a platform-independent, binary
file that also contains metadata describing the contents and format of the data
in the file.  Version 4 of the netcdf library stores data in HDF5 format files;
earlier versions stored data in a custom format.
The R package ncdf4 can read either format.
</p>
<p>NetCDF files contain one or more variables, which are usually
structured as regular N-dimensional arrays.  For example, you might
have a variable named &quot;Temperature&quot; that is a function of longitude,
latitude, and height. NetCDF files also contain dimensions, which 
describe the extent of the variables' arrays.  In our Temperature example,
the dimensions are &quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;, and &quot;height&quot;. Data can be read from
or written to variables in arbitrary hyperslabs (for example, you can 
read or write all the Temperature values at a given height, or at a given
latitude).  
</p>
<p>The R package 'ncdf4' allows
reading from, writing to, and creation of netCDF files, either netCDF version
3 or (optionally) netCDF version 4.  If you choose to create version 4
output files, be aware that older netcdf software might only be
able to read version 3 files.
</p>
<p>Note that both the
netCDF library and the HDF5 library must already be installed on your machine for 
this R interface to the library to work.
</p>
<p>If you are new to netCDF files, they can be a little overwhelming,
so here is a brief sketch of what documentation you need to read next.  
</p>
<p>If you want to READ data 
from an already-existing netCDF file, first call <code><a href="nc_open.html">nc_open</a></code> 
to open the file, then call <code><a href="ncvar_get.html">ncvar_get</a></code> to read the data
from a variable in the file.  
</p>
<p>If you want to WRITE data to a new netCDF file, the procedure is
to first define the dimensions your data array has, then define the
variable, then create the file.  So, first call
<code><a href="ncdim_def.html">ncdim_def</a></code> to define the dimensions that your data
exists along (for example, latitude, longitude, and time). Then call
<code><a href="ncvar_def.html">ncvar_def</a></code> to define a variable 
that uses those dimensions, and will hold your data.
Then call <code><a href="nc_create.html">nc_create</a></code>
to create the netCDF file.
Finally, call <code><a href="ncvar_put.html">ncvar_put</a></code>
to write your data to the newly created netCDF file, 
and <code><a href="nc_close.html">nc_close</a></code> when you are done.
</p>
<p>This is version 1.6 of the ncdf4 library. Not all features of netcdf-4 are
supported yet.
This version supports compression, chunking, groups, and multiple
unlimited dimensions.
User-defined types and &quot;vlens&quot; (variable-length arrays) are not supported yet.
