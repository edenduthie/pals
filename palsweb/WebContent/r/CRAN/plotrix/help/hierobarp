_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Breaks down a numeric element of a data frame by one or more
     categorical elements and displays the breakdown as a bar plot.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      hierobarp(formula=NULL,data=NULL,maxlevels=10,mct=mean,lmd=std.error,umd=lmd,
      x=NULL,xlim=NULL,ylim=NULL,main="",xlab="",ylab="",start=0,end=1,shrink=0.02,
      errbars=FALSE,col=NA,barlabels=NULL,labelcex=1,lineht=NA,showall=FALSE,
      showbrklab=FALSE,mar=NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 formula: A formula with a numeric element of a data frame on the left
          and one or more categorical elements on the right.

    data: A data frame containing the elements in 'formula'.

maxlevels: The maximum number of levels in any categorical element.
          Mainly to prevent the mess caused by breaking down by a huge
          number of categories.

     mct: The measure of central tendency function to use.

     lmd: The lower measure of dispersion function to use.

     umd: The upper measure of dispersion function to use.

       x: This becomes the result of the breakdown after the first
          call. Currently anything passed as this argument will be
          ignored.

xlim,ylim: Optional x and y limits for the plot.

    main: Title for the plot.

xlab,ylab: Axis labels for the plot.

start,end: The start and end values of the initial display. The user
          will almost certainly not want to change these.

  shrink: The proportion to shrink the width of the bars as more levels
          are added. This proportion increases with the number of
          levels.

 errbars: Whether to display error bars on the lowest level of
          breakdown.

     col: The colors to use to fill the bars. See Details.

barlabels: Optional group labels that may be useful if the factors used
          to break down the numeric variable are fairly long strings.

labelcex: Character size for the group labels.

  lineht: The height of a line of text in the lower margin of the plot
          in user units. This will be calculated by the function if a
          value is not passed.

 showall: Whether to display bars for the entire breakdown.

showbrklab: Whether to display the labels for the lowest level of
          breakdown.

     mar: If not NULL, a four element vector to set the plot margins.
          If new margins are set, the user must reset the margins after
          the function exits.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'hierobarp' displays a bar plot illustrating the breakdown of a
     numeric element of a data frame by one or more categorical
     elements. The breakdown is performed by 'hierobrk'. Typically, the
     mean of each category specified by the formula is displayed as the
     height of a bar. If 'showall' is TRUE, the entire nested breakdown
     will be displayed. This can be useful in visualizing the
     relationship between groups and subgroups in a compact format.

     The colors of the bars are determined by 'col'. If 'showall' is
     FALSE, the user only need pass a vector of colors, usually the
     same length as the number of categories in the final (first on the
     right side) element in the formula. If 'showall' is TRUE and the
     user wants to color all of the bars, a list with as many elements
     as there are levels in the breakdown should be passed. Each
     element should be a vector of colors, again usually the same
     length as the number of categories. As the categorical variables
     are likely to be factors, it is important to remember that the
     colors must be in the correct order for the levels of the factors.
     When the levels are not in the default alphanumeric order, it is
     quite easy to get this wrong.
