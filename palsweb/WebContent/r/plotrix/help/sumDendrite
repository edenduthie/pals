_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Find the sum of the counts that are the first elements of each
     list in the top level of a dendrite object.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      sumDendrite(x) 

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: A list with a numeric value as the first element in each of
          its toplevel elements.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     A 'dendrite' object is a possibly nested list of lists that
     contain the counts and pointers to sublists in each list. Such an
     object describes the  attributes of objects that can take on
     mutually exclusive attributes (that is, belong to disjunct sets).
     'sumDendrite' is a convenience function to get the total number of
     objects that are so classified.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The sum of the counts in the top level of lists.
