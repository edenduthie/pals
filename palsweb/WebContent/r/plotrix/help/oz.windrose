_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Displays a wind rose in the style used by the Australian Bureau of
     Meteorology.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      oz.windrose(windagg,speed.col=c("#dab286","#fe9a66","#ce6733","#986434"),
       speed.width=c(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8),show.legend=TRUE,legend.pos=27,...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 windagg: A matrix of percentages with the rows representing speed
          ranges and the columns indicating wind directions.

speed.col: Colors representing speed ranges.

speed.width: Half widths of the bars representing speed ranges.

show.legend: Logical indicating whether to display a legend.

legend.pos: The vertical position of the wind rose legend. The
          Australian Bureau of Meteorology displays the legend at the
          top of the plot

     ...: additional arguments passed to 'plot'.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'oz.windrose' displays a wind rose in the style used by the
     Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Each limb represents a bin of
     wind directions, and  there are conventionally eight bins. If
     'windagg' has more than eight columns, more limbs will be
     displayed. The rows of 'windagg' represent the speed ranges used
     by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (0, 0-10,  10-20, 20-30
     and over 30 in km/hour). The diameter of the central circle is
     calculated as (percent calm observations)/(number of direction
     bins). The remaining grid circles are spaced from the
     circumference of the "Calm" circle.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     nil

_N_o_t_e:

     If a title is desired, remember to move the legend to the bottom 
     of the plot. If the function is passed values that do not sum to
     100, the resulting plot will at best be misleading.
