_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Displays a Gantt chart with priority coloring

_U_s_a_g_e:

      gantt.chart(x=NULL,format="%Y/%m/%d",xlim=NULL,taskcolors=NULL,
       priority.legend=FALSE,vgridpos=NULL,vgridlab=NULL,vgrid.format="%Y/%m/%d",
       half.height=0.25,hgrid=FALSE,main="",xlab="",cylindrical=FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a list of task labels, start/end times and task priorities as
          returned by 'get.gantt.info'. If this is not present,
          'get.gantt.info' will be called.

  format: the format to be used in entering dates/times (see
          'strptime').

    xlim: the horizontal limits of the plot.

taskcolors: a vector of colors used to illustrate task priority.

priority.legend: Whether to display a priority color legend.

vgridpos: optional positions of the vertical grid lines.

vgridlab: optional labels for the vertical grid lines.

vgrid.format: format for the vertical grid labels.

half.height: the proportion of the spacing between task bars that will
          be filled by the bar on each side - 0.5 will leave no space.

   hgrid: logical - whether to display grid lines between the bars.

    main: the title of the plot - note that this is actually displayed
          using 'mtext'.

    xlab: horizontal axis label - usually suppressed.

cylindrical: Whether to give the bars a cylindrical appearance.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     If task priority colors are not wanted, set 'taskcolors' to a
     single value to suppress the coloring. If this is not done,
     'rainbow' will be called to generate a different color for each
     task.

     There can now be more than one time interval for each task. If
     there is, more than one bar will be displayed for each "task",
     which may not be a task at all, but intervals of some attribute
     for each entity.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The list used to create the chart - see 'get.gantt.info' for
     details. This can be saved and reused rather than manually
     entering the  information each time the chart is displayed.
