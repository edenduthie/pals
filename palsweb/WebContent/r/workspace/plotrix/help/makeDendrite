_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Build a list of mutually exclusive attributes from a matrix of 
     category indicators.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      makeDendrite(x)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: A data frame or matrix where rows represent objects and
          columns mutually exclusive attributes of a given class.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The values in 'x' indicate which attribute of a particular class
     is possessed by the object. For instance, the attributes dead and
     alive are mutually exclusive. 'makeDendrite' creates a nested list
     that contains the counts of successive combinations of the
     attributes. The top level attributes are taken from the first
     column, then those are combined with the attributes in the second
     column and so on.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list of the counts of objects for each combination of the
     attribute classes.
