_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Transform numeric values into colors.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      color.scale(x,redrange=c(0,1),greenrange=c(0,1),bluerange=c(0,1),
       extremes=NA,na.color=NA)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a numeric vector, matrix or data frame

redrange,greenrange,bluerange: color ranges into which  to scale 'x'

extremes: The colors for the extreme values of 'x'.

na.color: The color to use for NA values of 'x'.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'color.scale' calculates a sequence of colors by a linear
     transformation of the numeric values supplied into the ranges  for
     red, green and blue. If only one number is supplied for a color
     range, that color remains constant for all values of 'x'. If more
     than two values are supplied, the 'x' values will be split into
     equal ranges (one less than the number of colors) and  the
     transformation carried out on each range. Values for a color range
     must be between 0 and 1.

     If 'extremes' is not NA, the ranges will be calculated from its
     values using 'col2rgb', even if ranges are also supplied.
     'extremes' allows the user to just pass the extreme color values
     in any format that 'col2rgb' will accept.

     The user may not want the color scheme to be continuous across
     some critical point, often zero. In this case, color scale can be
     called separately for the values below and above zero. See the
     second example for 'color2D.matplot'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A vector or matrix of hexadecimal color values.

_N_o_t_e:

     The function is useful for highlighting a numeric dimension or
     adding an extra "dimension" to a plot.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'rescale', 'col2rgb'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

      # go from green through yellow to red with no blue
      x<-rnorm(20)
      y<-rnorm(20)
      # use y for the color scale
      plot(x,y,col=color.scale(y,c(0,1,1),c(1,1,0),0),main="Color scale plot",
       pch=16,cex=2)
