_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Try to find the largest empty rectangle on a plot.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      emptyspace(x,y=NA,bars=FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     x,y: x and y positions of the points or centers and heights of the
          bars

    bars: Whether to add x and y points to represent the bars if the
          plot is a barplot.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'emptyspace' divides the area defined by 'par("usr")' into smaller
     and smaller rectangles until at least one rectangle has no points
     defined by 'x' and 'y' within it. It then tries to find the
     largest such rectangle if more than one exists and calculates its
     center. If the plot is very crowded, the resulting rectangle may
     be very small.

     'emptyspace' will accept a list of at least two matrices as if it
     was returned from 'brkdn.plot', calculate the positions of the
     ends of the dispersion bars and then try to find an empty
     rectangle. It will also accept a list of x-y coordinates, looking
     for the first element to have the name 'x', and set 'y' to the
     second element.

     Note that if there are any NAs in 'x' or 'y', emptyspace will
     fail.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The 'x' and 'y' coordinates of the center of the rectangle found.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):
