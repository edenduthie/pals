_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Places labels on an axis in a regular staggered order

_U_s_a_g_e:

      staxlab(side=1,at,labels,nlines=2,top.line=0.5,line.spacing=0.8,...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    side: axis on which to place the labels, as in 'axis'

      at: where to place the labels in user units, as in 'axis'

  labels: text strings

  nlines: How many lines to use to stagger the labels.

top.line: Distance from the axis to place the first line of text.

line.spacing: Spacing between lines of text labels.

     ...: Additional arguments to be passed to 'mtext'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     nil

_N_o_t_e:

     This function is mainly useful when either long axis labels or a
     large number of labels are to be placed without overlapping. It
     staggers the  labels along the axis specified. The user may wish
     to increase the space beneath the plot using 'mar' before calling
     'staxlab'. It is probably only useful on the bottom or left side
     of the plot.
