<h2>Define a netCDF Variable</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>Defines a netCDF variable.  This variable initially only exists in memory.
It is later written to disk using <code>nc_create()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
 ncvar_def( name, units, dim, missval, longname=name, prec="float", 
 shuffle=FALSE, compression=NA, chunksizes=NA, verbose=FALSE )
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>


<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the variable to be created (character string).  
The name can 
optionally have forward slashes in it, in which case the variable will be defined 
in the indicated group. For example, a variable
named <code>model3/run1/Temperature</code> will define a group named <code>model3</code>, with a
subgroup named <code>run1</code>, which will hold a variable named <code>Temperature</code>. Using
groups forces a netcdf version 4 file to be written. Note that older software might not
be able to read netcdf version 4 files.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>units</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable's units (character string). Or, pass a zero length string (&rdquo;) to have no units attribute.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dim</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable's dimension(s) (one or a list of &quot;ncdim4&quot; class objects, as returned by <code>ncdim_def</code>).  To create a variable with NO dimensions, pass an empty list (&quot;list()&quot;). </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>missval</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable's missing value. If NO missing value is desired, pass a NULL, or omit this argument entirely. If a NaN missing value is desired, pass an NA.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>longname</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional longer name for the variable, which is assigned to the variable's &quot;long_name&quot; attribute. For example, a variable named &quot;TS&quot; might have the longname &quot;Surface Temperature&quot;</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>prec</code></td>
<td>
<p>Precision of the created variable.  Valid options: 'short' 'integer' 'float' 'double' 'char'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>shuffle</code></td>
<td>
<p>Turns on (if TRUE) or off (if FALSE, the default) the shuffle filter.  According to 
netcdf docs, turning the shuffle filter on can improve compression for integer variables.
Turning the shuffle filter on forces the created file to be in netcdf version 4 format,
which will not be compatible with older software that only reads netcdf version 3 files.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>compression</code></td>
<td>
<p>If set to an integer between 1 (least compression) and 9 (most compression), this
enables compression for the variable as it is written to the file.
Turning compression on forces the created file to be in netcdf version 4 format,
which will not be compatible with older software that only reads netcdf version 3 files.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>chunksizes</code></td>
<td>
<p>If set, this must be a vector of integers with a length equal to the number
of dimensions in the variable. When data from this variable is written to the file, it
will be buffered in blocks as indicated by the chunksize. The order of dimensions
in this vector is the standard R ordering of XYZT. In some instances, setting a 
chunksize that reflects how the variable's data will be read or written can greatly
reduce read or write times. See the netcdf documentation for more detail on how to set this
parameter. Enabling this feature forces the created file to be in netcdf version 4 format,
which will not be compatible with older software that only reads netcdf version 3 files.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Print debugging information.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>


<p>This routine creates a netCDF variable in memory.  The variable can then
be passed to the routine <code>nc_create</code> when writing a file to disk.
</p>
<p>Note that this interface to the netCDF library includes more than the
minimum required by the netCDF standard.  I.e., the netCDF standard allows
variables with no units or missing values.  This call requires units and 
a missing value,
as it is useful to ensure that all variables have units and
missing values, and considerably easier to include them in this call than it is
to add them later.  The units and missing value are implemented through attributes
to the variable, named &quot;units&quot; and &quot;missing_value&quot;, respectively.
This is standard practice in netCDF files.
</p>
<p>After a variable is defined with this call, and created on disk using
<code><a href="nc_create.html">nc_create</a></code>, then data values for the variable can be written
to disk using <code><a href="ncvar_put.html">ncvar_put</a></code>.
</p>
<p>This function returns a <code>ncvar</code> object, which describes the newly-created
variable.  However, the <code>ncvar</code> object is used for more than just
creating new variables.  The function <code><a href="nc_open.html">nc_open</a></code> returns a <code>ncdf4</code>
class object that itself contains a list of <code>ncvar4</code> objects that describe
the variables in an existing, on-disk netCDF file.  (Note that coordinate
variables are NOT included in this list.  Attributes of the coordinate variables
are kept in the <code>ncdim4</code> class object instead.)
</p>
<p>The <code>ncvar4</code> class object has the following fields, which are all read-only:
1) name, which is a character string containing the name of the variable;
2) units, which is a character string containing the contents of the
variable's &quot;units&quot; attribute; 3) missval, which contains the contents of the
variable's &quot;missing_value&quot; attribute; 4) longname, which is the 
contents of the variable's &quot;long_name&quot; attribute, or defaults to the name
of the variable if there is no &quot;long_name&quot; attribute; 5) ndims, which is the
number of dimensions this variable has; 6) dim, which is a list of objects of
class &quot;ncdim4&quot; (see <code><a href="ncdim_def.html">ncdim_def</a></code>), and describe this
variable's dimensions; 7) unlim, which is TRUE if this variable has an unlimited
dimension and FALSE otherwise; 8) varsize, which is a convenience array
that gives the shape of the variable (in XYZT ordering).
</p>
<p>Note that the missval attribute does not need to be used much in R, because
R's special value NA is fully supported.  I.e., when data is read in from an
existing file, any values equal to the &quot;missing&quot; value are set to NA.  When
data is written out, any NAs are set equal to the missing value.  If not
explicitly set by the user, a default value of 1.e30 is used for the missing
value.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>


<p>An object of class <code>ncvar4</code> that can later be passed to 
<code>nc_create()</code>.

# associated variable.  We just make an integer variable here for
# illustration purposes.
