_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Breaks down a numeric element of a data frame by one or more
     categorical elements.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      hierobrk(formula,data,maxlevels=10,mct=mean,lmd=NULL,umd=lmd)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 formula: A formula with a numeric element of a data frame on the left
          and one or more categorical elements on the right.

    data: A data frame containing the elements in 'formula'.

maxlevels: The maximum number of levels in any categorical element.
          Mainly to prevent the mess caused by breaking down by a huge
          number of categories.

     mct: The measure of central tendency function to use - defaults to
          the normal standard error.

     lmd: The lower measure of dispersion function to use.

     umd: The upper measure of dispersion function to use.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'hierobrk' performs the breakdown of a numeric element of a data
     frame by one or more categorical elements. For each category and
     optionally subcategories, the variable on the left of the formula
     is summarized as specified by the functions named in 'num.desc'.

     The user should take care when specifying different summary
     functions. 'hierobarp' expects a measure of central tendency as
     the first function and measures of dispersion as the second and
     third, if "error bars" are to be displayed.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list with four elements: 

 mctlist: The array produced by the function passed as the 'mct'
          argument.

 lcllist: The array produced by the function passed as the 'lmd'
          argument.

 ucllist: The array produced by the function passed as the 'umd'
          argument.

barlabels: A list containing the unique elements of the variables on
          the right side of the formula (or the levels if they are
          factors), in the order in which they appear in the formula.
          These will be the default labels for the 'hierobarp'
          function.

     This function is similar to 'brkdn' in the 'prettyR' package, but
     is structured to be used with the 'hierobarp' function.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

       Sex=sample(c("M","F"),100,TRUE),
       Marital=sample(c("M","X","S","W"),100,TRUE),
       Employ=sample(c("FT","PT","NO"),100,TRUE))
      hierobrk(formula=Age~Sex+Marital+Employ,data=test.df)
