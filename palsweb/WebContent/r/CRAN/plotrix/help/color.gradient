_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     'color.gradient' is now just a call to 'color.scale' with a vector
     of equally spaced integers (1:nslices). The function is kept for
     backward compatibility.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      color.gradient(reds,greens,blues,nslices=50)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

reds,greens,blues: vectors of the values of the color components as 0
          to 1.

 nslices: The number of color "slices".

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A vector of hexadecimal color values as used by 'col'.

_N_o_t_e:

     The function is mainly useful for defining a set of colors to
     represent a known number of gradations. Such a set can be used to
     assign a grade to a small number of values (e.g. points on a
     scatterplot - but see  'color.scale' for large numbers) and
     display a color bar using 'gradient.rect' as a legend.

      # try it with red and blue endpoints and green midpoints.
      color.gradient(c(0,1),c(1,0.6,0.4,0.3,0),c(0.1,0.6))
