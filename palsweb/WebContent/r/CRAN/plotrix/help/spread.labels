_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Places labels for irregularly spaced values in a regular staggered
     order

_U_s_a_g_e:

      spread.labels(x,y,labels=NULL,ony=NA,offsets=NA,between=FALSE,
       linecol=par("fg"),srt=0,...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     x,y: x and y data values

  labels: text strings

     ony: Whether to force the labels to be spread horizontally (FALSE)
          or vertically (TRUE). Defaults to whichever way the points
          are most spread out.

 offsets: How far away from the data points to place the labels.
          Defaults to one quarter of the plot span for all, staggered
          on each side.

 between: Whether to place the labels between two sets of points.

 linecol: Optional colors for the lines drawn to the points.

     srt: Rotation of the labels in degrees.

     ...: additional arguments passed to 'text'.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This function is mainly useful when labeling irregularly spaced
     data points that are "spread out" along one dimension. It places
     the labels regularly spaced and staggered on the long dimension of
     the data, drawing lines from each label to the point it describes.

     If 'between' is TRUE, the function expects two points for each
     label and will attempt to place the labels between two vertical
     lines of points. Lines will be drawn from the ends of each label
     to the two corresponding points.

     If spreading labels horizontally, the user may wish to rotate the
     labels by 90 degrees ('srt=90'). If long labels run off the edge
     of the plot, increase the 'xlim' for extra room.
