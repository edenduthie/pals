_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     'thigmophobe.labels' places labels adjacent to each point, 
     offsetting each label in the direction returned by  'thigmophobe'.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      thigmophobe.labels(x,y,labels=NULL,text.pos=NULL,...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     x,y: Numeric data vectors or a list with two components. 
          Typically the x/y coordinates of plotted points.

  labels: A vector of strings that will be placed adjacent to each
          point. Defaults to the indices of the coordinates.

text.pos: An optional vector of text positions (see  'text').

     ...: additional arguments are passed to 'text'

     .

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Typically used to automatically place labels on a scatterplot or 
     similar to avoid overlapping labels. 'thigmophobe.labels' will
     sometimes place a label off the plot or fail to separate labels in
     clusters of points. The user can manually adjust the errant labels
     by running 'thigmophobe' first and saving the returned vector.
     Then modify the position values to place the labels properly and
     pass the edited vector to 'thigmophobe.labels' as the 'text.pos'
     argument. This takes precedence over the positions calculated by
     'thigmophobe'.

     Both 'pointLabel' in the 'maptools' package and 'spread.labs' in
     the 'TeachingDemos' package use more sophisticated algorithms to
     place the labels and are worth a try if 'thigmophobe' just won't
     get it right.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A vector of directions away from the point nearest to each point.
