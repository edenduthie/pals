_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     'cluster.overplot' checks for overlying points in the x and y
     coordinates passed. Those points that are overlying are moved to
     form a small cluster of up to nine points. For large numbers of
     overlying points, see 'count.overplot' or 'sizeplot'. If you are
     unsure of the number of overplots in your data, run
     'count.overplot' first to see if there are any potential clusters
     larger than nine.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      cluster.overplot(x,y,away=NULL,tol=NULL,...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     x,y: Numeric data vectors or the first two columns of a matrix or
          data frame. Typically the x/y coordinates of points to be
          plotted.

    away: How far to move overlying points in user units. Defaults to
          the width of a lower case "o" in the x direction and 5/8 of
          the height of a lower case "o" in the y direction.

     tol: The largest distance between points that will be considered
          to be overlying. Defaults to 1/2 of the width of a lower case
          "o" in  the x direction and 1/2 of the height of a lower case
          "o" in the y  direction.

     ...: additional arguments returned as they are passed.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list with two components. For unique x-y pairs the elements will
     be  the same as in the original. For overlying points up to eight
     additional  points will be generated that will create a cluster of
     points instead of one.
