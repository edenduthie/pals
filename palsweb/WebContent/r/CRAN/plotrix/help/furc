_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Plot one level of a dendrogram displaying two or more mutually 
     exclusive attributes.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      furc(x,xpos,yrange,toplevel,cex=1)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: A 'dendrite' object containing the counts of objects having
          combinations of mutually exclusive attributes.

    xpos: The horizontal position on the plot to display the current
          level of the dendrogram.

  yrange: The range of values in which the current level of the
          dendrogram will be displayed.

toplevel: A flag for the function to know whether it is at the top
          level of the dendrogram or not. Do not change this argument.

     cex: The character expansion to use in the display.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'furc' displays one _furc_ation of the dendrogram. A furcation is
     a single box displaying its label and count that may split into
     finer divisions. If so, 'furc' calls itself for each furcation
     until there are no more splits.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     nil
