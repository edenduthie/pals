_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

soiltexture: Matrix of soil textures where each row is a soil sample
          and three columns containing the percentages of the
          components sand, silt and clay in the range 0 to 100.

    main: The title of the soil texture plot. Defaults to nothing.

      at: Positions on the three axes where ticks will be drawn.

axis.labels: Labels for the axes.

tick.labels: The tick labels for the three axes.

show.names: Logical - whether to show the names of different soil types
          within the soil triangle.

show.lines: Logical - whether to show the boundaries of the different
          soil types within the soil triangle.

col.names: Color of the soil names. Defaults to gray.

bg.names: Color to use when drawing a blank patch for the names of soil
          types.

show.grid: Logical - whether to show grid lines at each 10 level of
          each soil component.

col.axis: Color of the triangular axes, ticks and labels.

col.lines: Color of the boundary lines. Defaults to gray.

col.grid: Color of the grid lines. Defaults to gray.

lty.grid: Type of line for the grid. Defaults to dashed.

show.legend: Logical - whether to display a legend.

label.points: Logical - whether to call 'thigmophobe.labels' to label
          the points.

point.labels: Optional labels for the points or legend.

col.symbols: Color of the symbols representing each value.

     pch: Symbols to use in plotting values.

h1,h3,t1,t3: Points used in drawing boundaries for soil types.

   lwduk: Line width for the boundaries

xpos,ypos: Positions for the soil type labels.

  snames: Soil type labels.

   cexuk: Character expansion for the soil type labels.

     ...: Additional arguments passed to 'triax.points' and then
          'points'.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'soil.texture.uk' displays a triangular plot area on which soil
     textures defined as proportions of sand, silt and clay can be
     plotted. It is similar to the 'soil.texture' function but uses the
     UK display conventions.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If 'soiltexture' was included, a list of the 'x,y' positions of
     the soil types plotted. If not, nil.
