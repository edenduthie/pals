     'getFigCtr' reads parameters about the current plot and calculates
     the vertical and horizontal centers of the figure region. This is
     typically useful for placing a centered title on plots where the
     left and right margins are very different.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A two element vector containing the coordinates of the center of
     the figure region in user units.
