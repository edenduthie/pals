_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Plots a set of (x,y) data with repeated points denoted by larger
     symbol sizes

_U_s_a_g_e:

      sizeplot(x, y, scale=1, pow=0.5, powscale=TRUE, size=c(1,4), add=FALSE, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: x coordinates of data

       y: y coordinates of data

   scale: scaling factor for size of symbols

     pow: power exponent for size of symbols

powscale: (logical) use power scaling for symbol size?

    size: (numeric vector) min and max size for scaling, if
          powscale=FALSE

     add: (logical) add to an existing plot?

     ...: other arguments to 'plot()' or 'points()'

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Most useful for plotting (e.g.) discrete data, where repeats are
     likely.  If all points are repeated equally, gives a warning.  The
     size of a point is given by scale*n^pow, where n is the number of
     repeats, if powscale is TRUE, or it is scaled between size[1] and
     size[2], if powscale is FALSE.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A plot is produced on the current device, or points are added to
     the current plot if 'add=TRUE'.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'symbols'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

      x <- c(0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.3,0.3)
      y <- c( 1,  1,  1,  1,  2,  2,  2,  3,  3,  4,  5 )
      plot(x,y)
      sizeplot(x,y)
