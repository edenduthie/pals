_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Calculate the counts of the weighted values in specified bins and 
     optionally display either a frequency or density histogram.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      weighted.hist(x,w,breaks="Sturges",col=NULL,plot=TRUE,
      freq=TRUE,ylim,ylab=NULL,...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: A vector of numeric values

       w: A vector of weights at least as long as x.

  breaks: The endpoints of the ranges into which to count the weighted
          values.

     col: An optional vector of colors for the bars of the histogram.

    plot: Whether to plot a histogram.

    freq: Whether to plot counts or densities.

    ylim: The limits of the plot ordinate.

    ylab: Label for the ordinate.

     ...: Additional arguments passed to 'barplot'.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'weighted.hist' calculates the weighted counts of values falling 
     into the ranges specified by 'breaks'. Instead of counting each 
     value as 1, it counts the corresponding value in 'w' (the weight).

     'breaks' may be specified by a monotonically increasing vector  of
     numbers that are interpreted as the endpoints of the ranges, a 
     single number representing the number of ranges desired or the
     name  of the function to calculate the ranges (see 'hist'). If a
     vector of numbers is passed that does not include all values in 
     'x', the user is warned. If the ranges are not equal, a warning 
     will be displayed if 'freq' is TRUE or the heights of the bars 
     will be adjusted to display areas approximately equal to the
     counts  if 'freq' is FALSE.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list containing:

     breaks - The endpoints of the intervals

     counts - The weighted counts

     density - The weighted counts divided by their sum.

     mids - The midpoints of the intervals and the bars displayed.

     xname - the name of 'x'.

     equidist - Whether the intervals differ by less than the total
     range/1000.
