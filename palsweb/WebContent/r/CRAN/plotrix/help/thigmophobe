_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Find the direction away from the closest point

_U_s_a_g_e:

      thigmophobe(x,y)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     x,y: Numeric data vectors. Typically the x/y coordinates of
          plotted points. If arrays are passed, they will be silently
          coerced to numeric vectors.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'thigmophobe' returns the direction (as 1|2|3|4 - see pos= in 
     'text') away from the nearest point to each of the points 
     described by 'x' and 'y'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A vector of directions away from the point nearest to each point.

_N_o_t_e:

     Typically used to get the offset to automatically place labels on
     a scatterplot or similar using 'thigmophobe.labels' to avoid 
     overlapping labels. The name means "one who fears being touched".

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

     Jim Lemon - thanks to Gustaf Rydevik for the "names" bug fix and
     to Steve Ellison for the suggestion about arrays.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'thigmophobe.labels'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

      x<-rnorm(10)
      y<-rnorm(10)
      thigmophobe(x,y)
